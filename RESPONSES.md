# CISC230 - Phillip Hoang

## factorial2.cpp
The input that affects the number of call is n, the number that you are computing the factorial of.
n = 5, count = 6  
n = 10, count = 11
n = 20, count = 21
The function based on n is n+1.

## ireverse2.cpp

The input that affects the number of call is the amount of digits in n. The number you are computing the reverse number of.
n = 10, count = 3  
n = 100, count = 4
n = 1000, count = 5
The function based on n is [log_10(n)]+2.

## sreverse2.cpp

Nothing impacts the number of calls. The number of calls is constant.
n = apple, count = 1 
n = isaac newton, count = 1
n = how much wood could a woodchuck chuck, count = 1
The function based on n is 1.

## permute.cpp

The input that affects the number if calls is the length of the input for n. The string that we are finding all permutations of.
n = pi, count = 5
n = add, count = 16
n = math, count = 65
The function based on n is n! x e

## tower.cpp
The input that affects the number of call is n, the number that you are computing the amount of times each disk moves from A to C.
n = 1, count = 3 
n = 2, count = 7
n = 3, count = 15
The function based on n is 2^(n+1)-1

## fibonacci2.cpp (presented in video lesson)
The input that affects the number of call is n, the number that we are generating the fibonaaci numbers of.
n = 1, count = 1 
n = 2, count = 3
n = 10, count = 3
The function based on n is 1 call for n < 2 and 3 calls for n >= 2.
